                  We're glad you chose to visit the Comcest Services Limited,
                  ("Comcest Services Limited") site! We care about your privacy
                  and the information you share with us and want you to
                  understand how we are using and protecting the information we
                  collect about you. Comcest Services Limited is respectful of
                  data privacy and adopts best practice in compliance with
                  applicable privacy law and regulations, including the EU
                  General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").
                </p>
                <h3>Use of this website</h3>
                <p>
                  This privacy policy describes the information we collect from
                  you and how it may be stored and processed in the United
                  States of America and across the Comcest Services Limited
                  Publishing Network as described below. <br />
                  This website, and associated Comcest Services Limited events and
                  publications provide products, content, and services for a
                  professional and consumer audience
                </p>
                <h3>What information we collect</h3>
                <p>
                  Comcest Services Limited collects data about you that is limited
                  to the kind of information that can be found on a typical
                  business card: first name, last name, job title,
                  employer/company name, work address, work email, and work
                  phone number. In some cases, we may ask you to provide
                  additional professional information such as the size of the
                  company you work for, and industry type. To enhance and/or
                  update the information that you have provided to us, we may
                  combine it with professional information or personal data that
                  we collect from third party sources. The personal data that we
                  refer to in this document is the personal and professional
                  information you provide, as well as information that we obtain
                  from third party sources, both of which we typically combine
                  as one user record. This site also collects and stores certain
                  information automatically using cookies and similar
                  technologies, including IP addresses, the region or general
                  location of a computer or device accessing the internet,
                  browser type, operating system, page view history, and other
                  usage information. See our Cookie Policy for further details
                  or if you are an EU resident or California consumer, visit our
                  Member Preferences Center to modify your cookie settings.
                  However, to the extent that any cookie can uniquely identify a
                  computer, mobile device, or tablet ("Device"), or the person
                  using that Device, and you are an EU resident, under the GDPR,
                  this is personal data. Therefore, this privacy policy shall
                  apply to such personal data collected by Instant Media
                  Services. Similarly, if you are a California consumer, under
                  the CCPA, to the extent that any cookie can uniquely identify
                  you or the device you, or any other person is using, via an IP
                  address or other online identifier, this is also personal
                  data.
                </p>
                <h3>How we collect it</h3>
                <p>
                  We may collect your personal data when you register to receive
                  any of the products, content or services offered by Instant
                  Media Services or its third-party sponsors ("sponsors") such
                  as publications, subscriptions, contests, newsletters,
                  memberships, premium content, webcasts, video, white papers,
                  online seminars, conferences and events.
                </p>
                <h3>What happens if you don't provide personal data?</h3>
                <p>
                  In order for us to provide the products, content or services
                  you request, we need your personal data. Therefore, if you do
                  not provide such personal data, we cannot deliver the
                  products, content or services.
                </p>
                <h5>Comcest Services Limited Publishing Network</h5>
                <p>
                  This website is one of many that Comcest Services Limited and
                  its group of undertakings operates, all of which we
                  collectively refer to as the Comcest Services Limited Publishing
                  Network. Where permitted by law, we may share the personal
                  data we collect about you with another Comcest Services Limited
                  Publishing Network company so that we can provide you with
                  information about products, content and services that might
                  interest you
                </p>
                <h3>How do we safeguard your personal data?</h3>
                <h5>Security of your personal data</h5>
                <p>
                  Comcest Services Limited maintains safeguards which include
                  technical and organizational security measures to protect your
                  personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized use, access,
                  inadvertent disclosure, alteration, and destruction, and we
                  require the third parties we contract with to support Instant
                  Media Services business operations to employ reasonable
                  security measures as well (see "When and how we share your
                  information with others" below). We update and test security
                  on an ongoing basis and restrict access to your personal data
                  to only those who need to know in order to provide Instant
                  Media Services products, content or services to you.
                  <br />
                  We may store your personal data using Comcest Services Limited
                  own secure on-site servers or other internally hosted
                  technology. Your personal data may also be stored by third
                  parties, via cloud services or other technology, to whom
                  Comcest Services Limited has contracted with, to support Instant
                  Media Services business operations (see "When and how we share
                  your information with others" below). These third parties do
                  not use or have access to your personal data other than for
                  cloud storage and retrieval, and Comcest Services Limited
                  requires such parties to employ at least the same level of
                  security that we use to protect your personal data (see
                  "Security of your personal data" above).
                </p>
                <h3>What we do with the personal data we collect</h3>
                <p>
                  We use the personal data that we collect to communicate with
                  you, deliver what you request, improve our service, and to
                  present other information and business offers that may be of
                  interest.
                </p>
                <h5>To communicate with you</h5>
                <p>
                  We may use your personal data to send you important notices,
                  such as about your registration, transactions, and changes to
                  Comcest Services Limited terms, conditions, policies, and/or
                  other internal purposes.
                </p>
                <h5>To deliver what you request</h5>
                <p>
                  We may use your personal data to provide the products, content
                  or services you request. If you enter a sweepstake, contest,
                  or similar Comcest Services Limited promotion, we may use your
                  personal data to administer such promotion.
                </p>
                <h5>To improve our service</h5>
                <p>
                  We may use your personal data for auditing, data analysis, and
                  research to improve Comcest Services Limited products, content
                  and services.
                </p>
                <h5>To present offers that may be of interest to you</h5>
                <p>
                  We may contact you to offer you additional Instant Media
                  Services or third-party products, content or services that may
                  be of interest to you. When we contact you regarding any such
                  business offers, your personal data continues to be held by
                  Comcest Services Limited, unless you specifically indicate that
                  Comcest Services Limited can share it, such as when you tell us
                  you wish to receive a business offer from one of our
                  third-party sponsors.
                </p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                  The GDPR requires data collectors, such as Instant Media
                  Services, to have a legal basis to use the personal data of EU
                  residents. Therefore, this section shall apply to any such
                  personal data collected by Comcest Services Limited. Instant
                  Media Services uses the personal data that you provide to
                  supply you with high-quality products, content and services as
                  you request, to send important notices, and for internal
                  purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to
                  provide you with the information you need to make the most
                  informed technology purchasing decisions. We may also use your
                  personal data to offer you products, content or services that
                  may be of interest to you, based upon your interests or the
                  preferences you shared with us, and may share your personal
                  data with third party sponsors of content, events, and other
                  business services or offers. The legal basis for processing
                  your personal data is your consent. In certain circumstances
                  we may otherwise process your personal data if Instant Media
                  Services has a legitimate interest in doing so and Instant
                  Media Services is not infringing any of your rights and
                  freedoms. When Comcest Services Limited processes your personal
                  data for Comcest Services Limited legitimate interests, Instant
                  Media Services will consider and balance any potential impact
                  on you and your rights under data protection and any other
                  relevant law. Our legitimate business interests do not
                  override your interests. Comcest Services Limited will not use
                  your personal data in circumstances where your rights and
                  freedoms override our legitimate interests, unless we have
                  your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law.
                </p>

                <h3>When and how we share your personal data with others</h3>
                <p>
                  Comcest Services Limited may share your personal data to deliver
                  content and services from our sites, affiliated companies and
                  third parties services that might interest you, including
                  sponsored content and events, for business operations, and to
                  comply with valid legal processes. If you are an EU resident,
                  Comcest Services Limited will only share your personal data with
                  third parties outside of the Comcest Services Limited Publishing
                  Network, with your consent.
                </p>

                <h5>
                  For content and services that may interest you or that you
                  request
                </h5>
                <p>
                  As we mention above, your personal data may be shared within
                  the Comcest Services Limited Publishing Network to provide you
                  with information about products, content and services that
                  might interest you and for internal analytical and business
                  development purposes (see "Comcest Services Limited Publishing
                  Network" above). We may also share your personal data with
                  third parties to deliver third party sponsored content or
                  other services that you request (see "third party sponsored
                  content and events" below). As indicated above (see "To
                  present offers that may be of interest to you"), however, your
                  personal data continues to be held by Comcest Services Limited,
                  unless you specifically indicate that Comcest Services Limited
                  can share it with the third-party sponsor.
                </p>

                <h5>For business operations</h5>

                  We may also share your personal data with third parties we
                  have contracted with to support Comcest Services Limited
                  business operations including delivery, fulfillment, payment
                  processing, email deployment, suppression list management and

                </p>

                <h5>For third party sponsored content and events</h5>
                <p>
                  Comcest Services Limited partners with third party sponsors to
                  make available a large library of content to our users, such
                  as white papers, professional events (live or online), as well
                  as other business services or offers. In return for access to
                  such offers, we may ask you to provide us with personal data
                  as part of the registration. We may use your personal data to
                  send you the business offer you request. In addition, your
                  personal data may be shared with the third-party sponsor(s) of
                  the offer to communicate with you regarding the offer. Please
                  note that once your personal data is shared with the sponsor,
                  the sponsor's privacy policy, including information on how to
                  opt-out in the future, will apply to your personal data.
                </p>

                <h5>As required by law</h5>
                <p>
                  Your personal data may be shared when authorized by law or
                  necessary to comply with a valid legal process.
                </p>

                <h5>In the event of new ownership</h5>
                <p>
                  If part or all the ownership of Comcest Services Limited or any
                  of its products or services are sold or transferred, your
                  personal data will be transferred to the new owner.
                </p>

                <h3>How long we keep your personal data</h3>
                <p>
                  We retain your personal data for the duration of your business
